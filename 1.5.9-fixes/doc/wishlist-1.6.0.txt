wish list of version 1.6.0:

->  finish the implementation of the abstract OS layer.
->  implement the missing parts to port the library to linux
->  re-write the log/trace code
->  finish the implementation of friendly interfaces for the containers
      add new container types: hash, maps sets, trees, graphs, etc
->  split the library layer in many smaller units: Sil -> SilList, SilLockers, etc.
