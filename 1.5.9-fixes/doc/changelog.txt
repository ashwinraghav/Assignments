version developing-1.5.9-5.1 @ 2005-09-09 by leus,marianop

+ NEW:      created a Makefile to handle things such as automatic compilation,
        archive creation, an working copy cleaning.
        
+ FIX:      corrected the implementation of the expression and script evaluator 
        that were broken after the change in TSilObject. Now works OK.

        It were only implemented in the linux port.
        
+ FIX:      changed some uses of the deprecated Sil.Str.CompareText for the new 
        Sil.Text.Compare

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
version developing-1.5.9-5 @ 2005-09-03 by leus,marianop

+ ADD:      added a new datatype kind to the TypeReader: PChar.
+ ADD:      added a new overload for Cancel in the interface IQueue. 
        This one returns the items waiting for processing as a LinkeList.

+ ADD:      added new overloaded construction routines for TSilInterfaceListContainer.
+ NEW:      added a new implementation of IPointerList using a container as a basis.
+ NEW:      added a TSilPointerComparator to handle comparisson of pointers.
+ NEW:      added a function Sil.Os.Thread.IsMain to ask wether a thread is the 
        Main Thread more easily.
        
+ FIX:      the ThreadList were incorrectly initializing itself as a non thread-safe list.
+ ADD:      Major work in progress in the port to linux/freepascal.

+ FIX:      changes in the Notifier service so one can wait on a event for delivery.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
version developing-1.5.9-4.1 @ 2005-09-01 by leus,marianop

+ FIX:      corrected the TypeInfo invoker to correctly handle various datatypes, primarily those that need finalization. 
                Yet, they're not thoroughly tested, though.
        
+ ADD:      added Str.Coalesce and Vart.Coalesce, as a mimic of the standard SQL functions.
+ NEW:      Introduced new constructions for generic type handling, specifically there are 
            new objects for generic type conversion. 
                See units: SilL?TypeConversion, SilL?TypePointer, SilLmTypeConverter.

+ CHANGE:   We're previously removed several interfaces from TSilObject, but they were needed by some 
        implementations inside the library, so we added them to TSilInterfacedObject, which is the correct 
        holder for extra features. TSilObject is mainly for tiny implementations in which is important not 
        to consume extra memory. 
            We're corrected various units in which this removal provoked many malfunctions, 
        in particular: SilLmTrace, in which IReferenceable were used to get the instance pointer 
        of a class implementing a particular interface.
        
+ ADD:      added units for the freepascal 2.0 port of this library, in the directory source/lib/rtl/fp20

+ ADD:      Added a new method GetValueType to the XmlArguments interface, which infers the datatype 
        of the argument by checking some characters of the string value itself.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

version stable-1.5.2-pre17 @ 2004-07-19 by leus,marianop

+ OS Abstraction Layer
  - SilOkIpcMutex.pas
    o FIX: the destructor TSilMutex.Destroy was missing!!
      And with it, it was missing a call to DoRelease that was needed to free 
      the mutex object lock.

  - SilOtTimer.pas, SilOjTimer.pas
    o FIX: function Create in Sil.Os.Timer which received an IHandle as second 
      parameter was eliminated because of overload selection conflicts.

      of commands created during the transmission or reception chain.

  - SilSiLayer.pas
    o FIX: changed, in interface ILayerProtocol, the prototype of the SendPacket 
      method. Now it receives the ParameterList to be passed to the command created 
      for packet sending.

  - SilSmLayerProtocol.pas
    o FIX: changed, in interface ILayerProtocol, the prototype of the SendPacket method. 
      Now it receives the ParameterList to be passed to the command created for packet sending.

version stable-1.5.2-16 @ 2004-07-16 by leus,marianop

+ base tools
  - in Sil.Str (SilBtStr.pas)
    o changed Sil.Str.Move prototype: now is a function that returns the
      amount of data moved.

+ framework
  - in SilLiTraits.pas, SilLfTraits.pas
    o changed the adoption trait mechanism: now there is a record for every
      reference to be adopted, and the Adopt functions defined in SilLfTrais
      return a initialized copy of it. The users must declare its fields as
      belonging to this record type, and after Adopt-ing the may refer to the
      newly Instance field in the returned record.
      
      This solved some problems in destruction time which caused AV exceptions
      because of the reference being already destroyed when the Adopt(@Ref,  nil) 
      is being called.
      
    o Added a new overload of the Adopt function by which can be specified a
      desired interface to ask for in the Value parameter. The Instance field
      of the returned record points to a reference to this interface type.

  - in several places ... mainly: SilLmContainerTypes.pas, SilLkValue.pas:
    
    o changed the field declaration to begin using the new Adopt record type.

+ type conversion engine

  - in serveral files (mostly SilL?DataType*.pas, SilL?DataHandler.pas)
    o  Implemented some From conversion primitives that was missing.
    o  Changed the way in which the handlers uninitialize the referenced memory.
    o  Corrected the Variable stubs that were calling the incorrect handler for type conversion.
    o  Changed the place of some declaration to help readability.

+ services

  - in The Firebird API

    o now the API was made to work as before. The latest changes were about
      the implementation of the type handlers for the firebird buffer types
      handling. However, the Blob type implementation is still lacking.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

version stable-1.5.2-15 @ 2004-07-08 by leus,marianop

+ framework

  - in all the files related ... (SilL?Data*.pas, SilL?Value*.pas, etc ...)
    o The work is almost done. As is needed by other parts of the library it
    works now.

+ services

  - in the Firebird API
    o Now it works to an extent. Still missing some features like Blobs. We're
    still working.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

version stable-1.5.2-14 @ 2004-07-07 by leus,marianop

+ OS Abstraction Layer

  - in Sil.Os.Environment.Expand (SilOtEnvironment.pas)
    o  Changed the implementation of the Expand function to prevent an error
    caused by the compiler picking wrong version of the called Str.Replace
    function. The error was causing an exception EVariantConversion to raise.

+ framework

  - in all the files related ... (SilL?Data*.pas, SilL?Value*.pas, etc ...)
    o More work in progress on the Type conversion framework

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

version stable-1.5.2-13 @ 2004-07-02 by leus,marianop

+  base tools
  - in Sil.Str (SilBtStr.pas)
    o changed the name of Translate into the more descriptive: Replace.
    o Translate was made deprecated.

  - in several files, all those who have made use of it ... too many to count ...
    o fixed the use of Str.Translate to the new Sil.Str.Replace

+ framework

  - in all the files related ... (SilL?Data*.pas, SilL?Value*.pas, etc ...)
    o work in progress on the Type conversion framework

+ layers 

  - in SilLmWriter.pas
    o corrected a misplaced + 1 which provoked writing one extra char to the
      stream when the other end wasn't expecting it.

+ services

  - in the Firebird API
    o Work in progress: still doesn't compile, or rather: it maybe now compiles but it doesn't
      work anymore.  OK: we're working on that.    

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

version stable-1.5.2-12 @ 2004-06-25 by leus,marianop

+ library
  
  - in Sil.pas
    
    o published the Delphi types TClass and TObject along with their pointers.
    o published the new IValue<type> interfaces.  
    o changed IDataType to IDataType1, so the  old things now are using the
      IDataType1 version.
    
  - in SilBeDataType.pas
    
    o new TDataType: defined a new enumeration type which codes all the different possible
      datatypes available. It's numericaly compatible with the VARTYPE
      enumeration.
    
    o defined a record type which holds a value of TDataType and a set of
      flags (set of TDataFlag) which are used to modify the meaning of the code.

  - in SilBeTypes.pas

    o added the redirections for TClass and TObject, and their pointers, to the Delphi dependant
      unit.

    o changed the definition of the TDateTimeStamp record: now is packed record.

+ base tools

  - in Sil.DateTime (SilBtDateTime.pas)
    
    o added a new function Iif which selects between two TDateTime values
      depending on the state of a boolean argument.  

  - in Sil.Typ ancestor (SilBtDataType.pas)
    
    o changed the name of the Data function which was used to retrieve the
      PTypeData from a PTypeInfo, now it is called TypeData.

    o added a new subtool named Data to retrieve a tool which handles specific
      methods and conversions for the new TDataType enumeration.

  - in Sil.Vart (SilBtVart.pas)

    o new conversion function to pass from a TVarType to the Sil's
      TDataFieldType (deprecated now) enumeration.

+ framework classes

  - new type conversion engine
    o added several units to implement the new type conversion engine:
      all the SilL?DataType.pas, all the SilL?DataHandler.pas, all the
      SilL?DataType<type>.pas

  - in SilLiFiler.pas: changes in the IWriter interface
    o added a new version of the IWriter interface and renamed the old one to
      IWriter1. The changed were needed to provide a new set of WriteString
      and WriteWideString functions with an optional Size parameter.

  - SilLiValue.pas: 
    o changes in the IValue & IVariable interface: added some conversions that
      we're forgotten.
    o changed the 'Float' conversion of type Double to 'Double' to allow
      introduction of Single and Extended conversions.
    o published a redirection for all the IValue<type> and IVariable<type> interfaces.
    o renamed IDataType to IDataType1 and introduced a new and simpler
      IDataType.
  
  - in SilLiValue<type>.pas
    o all this units are generated by expanding 'template' include files (see codecentral
      ID=16429, thanks to Rossen Assenov for his excelent idea). Theirs
      interfaces and types are published by common names so upon using them
      one can reference _Type, _Value, _Default, and _Variable which expands
      to <type> (Smallint, for example), IValue<type> (IValueSmallint), a
      constant default for the type (in this case: a Smallint zero (0)), and
      IVariable<type> (in the example: IVariableSmallint)

    o changed the names of the 'template' units from SilLq to the new naming
      scheme. Now there are a new primary letter assigned to templates: 'T'
      and the scheme is: SilT?<content name><Interface or Implementation>,
      where 'content name' is the purpose of the template, ie the entity which
      is defined by expanding it, and 'Interface' or 'Implementation' are
      defined to allow the same name of unit in the case in which the template
      is for expanding in the unit interface part or in the implementation
      part.

  - in SilLmField.pas

    o changed the usage of IDataType to IDataType1 to mantain compatibility,
      and applied the changes required by the interface modification.

    o several readibility improvements and code misplacing were corrected.

  
  - in SilLmWriter.pas, and SilLmTypeWriter.pas

    o all the same changes obliged by the modifications in the IWriter
      interface. 

  - in SilLtField.pas
    o added a new option in creation of Fields: now it can be created by
    specifying an initial Variant which determines both the type of the field
    and its default value.


  - in Sil.Typ (SilLtTypeInfo.pas)
    o added a global (one and only one instance of it is permitted) list of
      type descriptors which can be accessed as Sil.Typ.List. Using this list
      one can access to the global data type conversion facilities.
      By accessing some type: 
          
          Sil.Typ.List.Integer

      now is possible to convert to any other type, provide the conversion is
      possible and makes sense:


          Sil.Typ.List.Integer.ToAnsiString(<params here>), or
          Sil.Typ.List.Integer.Convert(dtAnsiString, <params here>), and
          Sil.Typ.List.Integer.CanConvert(dtAnsiString)

      the last one enables us to ask for permitted conversion.

      This conversion functions are pretty simple to use, but its interface
      and function prototype are rather ugly (for a normal delphi programmer ;)
      So, there is a provission to support more user friendly conversions on
      top of this facility.
      
+ containers and support handlers

  o in TSilTypeHandler (SilLmContainerTypes.pas) 

    - changed the way in which the Handler takes the reference to the
      comparator: now it honors the Adoption trait marking and because of this
      it holds the comparator as a pointer rather as an interface.
    

+ OS Abstraction Layer

  -  in IProcess (SilOiProcess.pas)
    o added a property to ask the process about his exit code upon
      termination.

  - in Sil.Os.Thread (SilOjThread.pas)
    o  added a function to create a new thread list (??)

  - in TSilThreadList (SilOkThreadList.pas)
    o the methods that were virtual abstract now are virtual only because of
    the need for creation of additional base ThreadLists.

  - in SilOkProcess.pas and SilOmProcess.pas
    o changed the implementation to support the new ExitCode property.


  - in TSilSocket (SilOsSocket.pas)
    o correction of an implementation error: in the Bind's implementation
      we're wrongly forcing the socket type and protocol to Stream and TCP.


+ General Services 

  - in SilSmThreadPool.pas
    
    o corrected a new warning about the usage and assignation of the
      Result variable, that were introduced by update1 of Delphi7.
  

  - in SilStConfiguration.pas

    o the tool SilTools.Sv.Configuration now is implemented with a new class
      called TSilConfigFile instead of the olf TConfiguration.
  
  - in SilSmHttpTags.pas
    o corrected a reference to the Lexer instance that weren't protected
      against the possibility of it being nil.

  - in SilTool.Sv.Config (SilStConfig.pas) 

    o added new configuration format to the Generic Configuration Reader Tool,
      the new format is Inifile.

+ Layers
  
  - in SilLayer.Packer (SilLayer.pas)
    o added a new HTTP packer to allow communications with layers usign http
      protocol. (work in progress)

  - in SilSiLayerConnection.pas
    o added a new interface ILayerConnectionManager to allow hooking by the
    user of the failure of connection attempts.

  - in ILayerCommand and ILayerCommandList (SilSiLayer.pas)
    o added a new Params property to the Command object which allows the
      implementor to propagate values into calls to adyacent layers.

  - in ILayerLinkList (SilSiLayer.pas)
    o added a new overload version of Add which returns an interface to the
      specified object as an out parameter, to allow for simpler
      initialization sequences.
  
  - in ILayerProtocol (SilSiLayer.pas)
    o added new overloaded versions of SendPacket which takes a Command object
      intead of a bare IPacket, to allow propagation of the context and
      command parameters in the replying direction of a slave interaction.

  - in SilSmLayerProtocol.pas  
    o implemented the new version of SendPacket.
  
  - in SilSmLayerConnection.pas
    o some corrections in the connection loss detection logic.
    o added the usage of the new ILayerConnectionManager interface to emit the
      notifications.

  - in SilSmLayerConnectionServer.pas
    o corrected the implementation and added new features.

  - in SilSmLayerDeviceSocketDatagaram.pas
    o eliminated the use of the WriteLock that were not needed anymore.
    o corrected an error which caused the Socket to be unbinded when the
      Receive feature were not needed and thus disabled.
 

+ Components

  - in SilVmCustomButton.pas
    o missing inherited call in overriden MouseDown event routine which
      prevented the firing of normal OnMouseDown events.
  
+ Known problems

  - the SilFirebird API doesn't compile right now! It is because of the
    changes in the IValue a IVariable interfaces. We're working on that and
    more sooner than later we'll have an update to fix these.
    The new implementation we'll use the very new type conversion facility and
    the new generic Value and Variable base classes.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

version 1.5.2-09 @ 2004-04-23 by leus,marianop

+ base tools

  - in Sil.GUID (SilOjGuid.pas and SilOtGuid.pas)

    o added a new function Index which takes a GUID value and an array of
      GUIDs  and returns the index of the first GUID in the array or -1 if not
      found.

  - in Sil.Ref (SilLtReference.pas)

    o added a function (MainInterface) which returns the main IUnknown of an
      aggregated object.

    o added a function (Extend) that when is called on IExtensible returns the
      IAggregation which is needed to add new classes to the aggregation.

  - in Sil.DateTime (SilBtDateTime.pas)
    o changed DateTime.FromStr: added an argument to specify the pivoting Year
      to use when the string came in two digit year format.

+ framework classes

  - in TSilAggregation (SilLkAggregation.pas)
    o corrected an error in the handling of the IsPublished parameter.
    
  - in TSilInterfacedObject (SilLkInterfaced.pas)
    o eliminated a spurious method called GetRef.

  - in TTypeStreamReader and TTypeStreamWriter
    o minor corrections in the handling of Widestring values.

  - in Sil.pas
    o published the Delphi's type info encapsulation.
    o published a new tool for accessing the new typeinfo interfaces.
    
  - in SilLkObject.pas
    o changes in TSilObject: some interfaces implemented by TSilObject were
      made exposed to descendants by means of property accesors functions
      whose name is the same as the interface with <Get> prepended. 
      Examples: ILockingSet, ISynchronizable, IExtensible.


+ Adoption Traits

  - in SilLfTraits.pas

    o new function Adopt which takes a field reference and a interface value
      and applies the adoption traits rules to them asigning a new value to 
      the reference depending on the trait's presence.

+ IValue and IVariable

  - changes in SilLiValue.pas

    o the IValue and IVariable interface changes to reflect a new style in
      type accessing properties. 
      Before the interface offered a series of properties which returned the
      value  itself cast to the appropriate type.
      Now, it offers the same properties but these in turn returns am
      specific interface for every different type which has properties itself
      to access the value as needed.
    
  - added new units SilLiValue<Type> 
    o these units are implemented by the template expansion technique learned
      from an article on Borland codecentral (ID=16429) by Rossen Assenov.

  - changed the default TSilField implementation to the new IValue and
    IVariable layout.
    
+ Container support types
  
  - changes in type handler implementation:

    o the base TSilTypeHandler was splitted in two kinds of handler: one for
      static types and other for dynamic types requiring initialization and
      finalization semantics.

    o a Hook to the Type Handler was added to allow for notification of
      initializations and finalizations occurred.

  - all the support classes now are marked with the IAdoptionTrait.

  - new TypeHandler (TSilCompositeHandler):
    
    o added a new type handler that composes any number of others handlers in
      one, which serves to handle record types which contains variant parts.

    o added the required construction functions in SilContainer.Handler.

  - in SilLiContainer.pas 
    o change in IContainerTypes: we're exposed the ISynchronizable interface as a property of name
      Synchronized. This interface has only one function: Lock with takes a
      lock from the object thus preventing concurrent access.

  - in SilLiContainerStrings.pas

    o correction: the RStringData private record were made packed to ensure
      proper memory alignment for the composite type handler.

  - in SilLiContainerBase.pas
    o change in IBaseContainer: we're exposed the ILockingSet interface as a property of name Locking.
      This property allows any user of the container to make the instance lock
      capable, by setting the proper properties in this interface.

    o TSilBaseContainerType: the base container class type were made descendant of the
      TSilAggregableObject and, thus, the constructor accordingly updated to
      allow specification of an outer controller.

  - in SilLmContainerEnumerator.pas
    o changed constructor to allow specification of lock behaviour.
    o changed the Detach implementation to correct the destruction and unlock sequence.

  - in SilLmContainerInterfaces.pas
    o some corrections of the implementations.
    
  - in SilLmContainerStrings.pas
    o the TSilStringsHandler now were made a composition of a String handler
      with the one specified as data in the construction of the container.

  - in SilLmContainerTypes.pas
    o some corrections were made on the TSilCompositeHandler to correctly
      handle some special cases that were presented.


+ OS Abstraction Layer:

  - in SilOkSocket.pas
    o changed the DoAccept abstract method to return the address from the
      new accepted socket in addition to the handle.

  
+ layers
  
  -  in SilSmLayerDeviceSocketDatagram.pas
    o added a new Socket Datagram Layer which handles UDP connections.

  - in several units of class implementation
    o changes in the handling of the command object upon receiving an interrogation which prevented 
      the context from reaching to the last layer's Write method, and then, as the context is used 
      in UDP to hold the address from which the inquiry come and that address then is needed in the 
      reply to send the answer to the correct client.

  - new ILayerConnection

    o added a new helper class for stream connections which facilitates the
      use of the layers in asyncronous mode receiving notification as events and 
      implementing features like: automatic reconnection, connection retries,
      etc.

  - added a list which traces history of commands being created by different
    layers that is propagated with the command form layer to layer.

  - overloaded some creation functions to return the object being created as
    out parameter as well as a return value.

  - in ILayerCommand:
    o the Context property has been made setable.

  - in SilSmLayerProtocolCustomImate.pas
    o added an accessor function which can be used to implement a property in
      the descendants to obtain the ILayerProtocol.  

+ new features

  - added a new list: MemberList

    o Sil.List.MemberList: this list is like a parameter list but instead of
      using variants to store values it uses field pointers provided by the
      user and identified by name and typeinfo. So, when a parameter is setted, 
      the real field's content is assigned.

    o added a new tool to the List tool which is invoked by Sil.List.Members
      that provides a series of helper function in dealing with MemberList
      usage.

  - in SilTool.Sv added and published the new generic configuration

 


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

version 1.5.2-08 @ 2004-03-26 by leus,marianop

+  Base Tools:

  - correction in Sil.Int (SilBtInt.pas)

    o Int.ToHex: added a guard to prevent the execution of the conversion in 
      the a weird case in which a string constant appeared to be zero length.

  - change in Sil.Str (SilBtStr.pas)
    o the functions IsEmpty and NotEmpty now take an optional boolean argument 
      to indicate to trim the string before doing the test.

  - addition in Sil.Vart (SilBtVart.pas)
    o added a new IsNull function which takes a Variant and a Default and
      returns whichever is not null.

  - in Sil.Ref (SilLtReference.pas)
  
    o added a new tool function called Result which can be used to optimize
    the retunrning of interface references as Result of functions by taking
    advantage of a Delphi quirk: it doesn't cleans up the references of Result
    variables upon entering to it, so, in the case of a function returning always a
    reference to the same object, as the case of a property getter for
    example, it can check first if the Result is not nil and the value of the
    pointer is the same as the one it must return, then an interface copy can
    be avoided, and because of this were avoiding the calls to IUnknown's Release
    and AddRef functions.

  
+ Containers:
  - in SilLkContainerBase.pas
    o added Lockable support to the base container by overriding the default
      mechanism from TSilObject and redeclaring SetIsLockable to create a
      critical section.

  - in SilLmContainerList.pas and SilLmContainerVector.pas
    o added locking support that only works if in the constructor was provided
      a flag indicating that lock support must be enabled.

  - in SilLmContainerEnumerator.pas
    o speeded up the code by removing the inheritance from TAbstractEnumerator
      and reimplementing all the needed interfaces locally.

  - in SilLmContainerInterfaces.pas
    o added a simil of Sil.List.InterfaceList but implemented using
      Containers instead of the old TSilList.

  - in SilLmContainerSequence.pas
    o added a lite implementation of TSimpleSequence to test performance.

  - in SilLmContainerTypes.pas
    o TSilInterfaceComparator: defined a new reusable type comparator specialized in comparing
      interfaces.

  - in SilLtContainer:
    o published the new InterfaceList version which is compatible with
      Sil.List.InterfaceList() and can be accessed as:
      SilContainer.Vector.Interfaces() or SilContainer.List.Interfaces().

  - in SilLtContainer:
    o Sequence.Create(Container, Kind, Start, Delta) now returns the lite
      SimpleSequence.

+ List support:
  
  - in Sil.List (SilLtList.pas)
    
    o added a tool function ParamGet to retrieve a param value form a
      IParameters specifying a default value to return in case the parameter
      is not there.

+ OS Abstraction Layer:
  
  - in Sil.Os.Computer.Local (SilOiComputer.pas, SilOkComputer.pas and SilOmComputer.pas)
    o added a new function which gets the UserName in different possible
      formats.

  - in TSilFileInfoList (SilOkFileInfo.pas)
  
    o the function which splits the path from the file name now checks both
      kinds of path separator: '/' and '\'.

  - in TSilThread (SilOkThread.pas)
    
    o corrected some bad behaviour with the adoption traits's mixing with
      threads. code now looks ugly, but will be corrected as soon as a better
      solution is found.

  - in the NETAPI 32 encapsulation

    o several noncritical changes.

+ layers:
  
  - the Probase compatibility implementation layer is published.

  - all the layer implementations: 
    o added a IsBroken parameter in the Deactivate method of the ILayerControl
      and ILayerLinkControl which is used to indicate when a deactivation is 
      provoked by a los connection event.

  - changed the Stream layer to detect connection loss and signal it.
  - changed the layer link list to propagate the new IsBroken parameter.

  - the SilFileExchangeProtocol was updated to allow specifying filters in 
    the call to ReadDirectory.


+ Components:

  - in SilVm3dShape.pas
    o some changes in behaviour.


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

version 1.5.2-07 @ 2004-03-04 by leus,marianop

+ corrections:
  - in TSilObject:
    o changed the way that the AddRef and Release was implemented. Now we're
      calling the windows Interlocked routines because these were faster than
      our assembler counterparts. That's because de LOCK prefix. We're no way
      to know about multiprocessor machines and adapt to this as windows does.
      In single processor machines there is no need of the LOCK prefix but
      when there is more than one it is critical to ensure atomic operation.
      We discover that windows adapts its dlls and in the case that you are in 
      a single processor machine, the interlocked functions doesn't have this
      prefix and because of that, they run faster.

+ changes:
  - in Sil.Os.Locked:
    o eliminated some variations of the interlocked functions.

  - in SilOkHandled:
    o added a Locked parameter to its constructor Create to propagate the
    indication to create a critical section to the TSilInterfacedObject
    constructor.

+ added:
  - in Sil.Os.Computer:
    o added a function which returns the name of logged on user.

  - in SilOkHandled:
    o added a protected property HasHandle which returns False in the case
      that the object Handle is invalid (ie: is nil).

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

version 1.5.2-06 @ 2004-02-27 by leus,marianop

+ new features:
  - Traits expressed by means of implementing an empty interface:
    o Adoption: now an object which on of its interfaces is passed to a
      container can express their preference about being 'adopted' by the
      host. This allows and object to selectively determine if a reference
      over it (an addref) must be taken or not.

  - In the windows NETAPI encapsulation (windows NT only: SilOsWntNetapi32):
    o added the support for getting the near DC in the network. In fact: published
    NetDsGetName and all the support constants needed.

+ additions:
  -  Sil.pas: 
    o  Published NamedPipes interfaces and support types.

  - Sil.Os.Filesystem:
    o changed ReadDirectory to support specifying attributes to include and
      exclude from operation.
    o idem to GetList.
    
+ changes:
  - now Sil.Os.Thread.Spawn now honors the adoption trait's signaling in their
    IRunnable parameter, which means that if an objects implements
    IAdoptionTrait the thread will AddRef over it, and if not only a Weak
    reference (pointer) is maintained.
  
  - the SilFileExchangeProtocol was adapted to the new IDirectoryReader
    behaviour.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

version 1.5.2-05 @ 2004-02-17 by leus,marianop

+ Some additions in Sil.DateTime and Sil.Date tools
  -  added in Date  tool:
    o  Swap:  exchanges to variables of type TDate taken as var parameters.
  -  added in DateTime tool:
    o  Swap:  exchanges to variables of type TDate taken as var parameters.
    o  ToMinutes: returns a LongWord which is the TDateTime scaled to minutes.
    o MinutesBetween: returns how many minutes are between two TDateTime. 
    o  MinutesToNow: same as above, but Now is taken as one of the arguments.
    o HourOf: returns the Hour part of a TDateTime.

+ Additions to Sil.Os.Module
  - added in Module tool:
    o Get(String): new method to load a module searching for it by its name.

+ Corrections
  - Sil.Os.Task:
    o corrected "access violation" in Destroy of TSilTask (SilOkTask) caused
      by the presence of interface temporaries in a place where objects are
      beeing destroyed. The DoClearConnections protected procedure was added
      to solve that.

+  Minor implementation corrections
  - error in SystemTime to DateTime conversion routines:
    o Sil.Os.Timezone.LocalToGlobal's implementation was wrong.

+ Deleted some unused and deprecated files:
  - lib/os/linux: SilOcNetAPI.pas
  - lib/os/linux: SilOeNetAPI.pas
  - lib/os/linux: SilOhNetAPI.pas
  - lib/os/linux: SilOpNetAPI.pas
  - lib/os/win: SilOcNetAPI.pas
  - lib/os/win: SilOeNetAPI.pas
  
+ New implemented features: 
  - In the windows NETAPI encapsulation (windows NT only: SilOsWntNetapi32):
    o added the declarations and support por creating, deleting and enumerating network
      drives connections, ie: connect to shares specifying user and password.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

version 1.5.2-04 @ 2004-02-16 by leus.

+ New demo directory structure:
  - started from scratch new demos more documented and explained.
  -  added a new project group that contains all the demos. (see ./programs/demos/demos.bpg)
  -  added a group of demos of framework functionality: aggregation, extension, events & lockers.

  -  added a demo of ILinkedList.
  -  added a demo of the useof the (unpublished yet) Delphi Typeinfo interfaces.
  -  added a demo of the container basic functions.
  - added a demo of Global Service List

  ... more demos coming soon so, keep in touch!

+ Changed file locations:
  
  - several docs that was in spanish now were moved to de doc/lc/sp folder.
  - added a babelfish translation of our .DOCs links found in the borland newsgroups
    Thanks to Paul Ericksen for the translations. 
    We'll touching this docs to correct the errors and we'll post the updated 
    versions in a few days.
    For now, just the plain versions as HTML.

+ Corrections:
  - in SilBtStr:
    o Token: does not need to check for termination right before exit.
    o TokenToArray: eliminated check to see if returned item was empty string.

  -  in SilLfParameters:
    o  changed some internal names to avoid overloads.
    o  added several missing utilities.
    o corrected the use of the symbolic names <DP60> for the use of <D60> 
      which means all Delphi after and including Delphi6

  - in SilLmContainerSequence.pas
    o Now checks for invalid cursors and uses the default of the container.
    o  Corrected the end of sequence test.

  - Eliminated deprecated unit SilLmPointerArray.

  - SilLtContainer.pas:
    o changed Sequence.Create(Cursor, Cursor, Kind) 
      for Sequence.Create(Container, Cursor, Cursor, Kind): 
      now receives the container.
        
  -  in SilLtTool.pas:
    o  changed Sil.List to publish a Params internal tool to replace Sil.List.Parameters.
    o published in this new tool many utilities to handle IParameterList.
    o now is possible to construct a IParameterList by specifying a parameter array. 

  - SilLtReference.pas:    
    o Ref.Free which receives a instance now checks for a nil argument before testing his ClassType.
  
  - SilLmInvokeParam.pas:
    o this unit is yet experimental: added support to assign Integer parameters to check the demo functionality.      
  
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

version 1.5.2-03 @ 2004-02-12 by leus.

+ Corrected demos: TestListSpeed, TestBase & TestList in ./programs/demos/lib/base/containers/ subdirs 1, 2 & 3;
+ Deleted many unused local units in the same directories which were replaced by the library itself.
+ SilLkAggregation.pas:
  - Corrected a bug in the implementation of the aggregate container. The code was using a container
  of a record type, but in the insertion point, there was passing a single value.
  So, one of the fields of the record was initialized with garbage.

+ SilLkObject.pas:
  - Changed the return of the ILockingSet::GetIsLockable to a fixed result of False. It was done to speed up
  the most common case of nonlockable objects returning False without the need to check for the
  implementation of the ILockable interface. The ILockingSet::GetLockable still returns the interface is one
  descendant provides it.
  - Changed the implementation of the ISerializable::Lock. Before that it was returning nil for an object
  that wasn't lockable. Now, it returns a stub implementation of ILock so that the code using it can
  reliably assume that it can reference tha result of tha call to Locked without checking for the result.

+ SilLmConnectableExtension.pas:
  - The Connectable Extension assumed that the aggregator object was passing himself to receive notifications of
  connections made to it in the Param argument to the default constructor.
  Now, it checks for the IConnectable hook in the Owner and the Controller if they are valid values.

+ SilLmContainerList.pas:
  - A simple correction in the item validation routine: now it checks if the Item parameter if different
  from HNull. In this case this is an important check because the HItem in the Linked List is a pointer
  to a node and the code assumes tha if it is different from nil it was valid.
  This change allows to call TSilBaseList.GetNext(var HItem) passing HNull as first value to begin the
  enumeration.

  - Eliminated the call to Locked to speed up enumerations. Now, it is only called once in the first invocation
  befores accessing to the FFirst field.

+ SilLmContainerVector.pas:
  - Corrected a faulty implementation in TSilBaseVector.Insert() of the movement of items that happens in
  the case of an insertion in the middle of the container.

  - Changes in TSilBaseVector.GetNext that allows to pass as first value HNull to begin the enumeration.

version 1.50:

  11-nov-2001: leandro
    He cambiado Sil.Os.Configuration por Cambio Sil.Os.Registry,
    a causa de que ya ha quedado convertida al nuevo formato.

    Nueva implementacin de Sockets finalizada y testeada con exito.

version 1.42:

  13-sep-2001 marianop  bug corregido en el manejo de threads.
    la llamada Sil.OS.Thread.Current fallaba en ciertos casos dentro de una dll.
    se soluciono cambiando la threadvar por un lookup en la lista de threads.

  30-ago-2001 leandro   Varios cambios en la nomenclatura y en la disposicin de los manejadores de items ...

    se cambi:

          ObjectPtr      a ObjectHandler,
          InterfacePtr  a InterfaceHandler,
          StringPtr      a StringHandler,
          VoidPtr        a VoidHandler.

    Ademas se introdujeron dos subtipos abstractos que permiten diferenciar si los items son del tipo puntero,
    o si son datos estructurados. De el primero descienden los Void, Interface, Dynamic y Object. De el segundo
    descienden los manejadores de String, Variant, y de todo los tipos Record ...

    Este cambio provoca que a partir de esta version, en todas las lista que reciben punteros
    (PointerList y StringList), haya que pasar el item por direccin y no por valor. Esto se debe hacer asi
    con todos los tipos excepto Punteros (void) y Objetos. El caso de las interfaces es la unica excepcin a
    este caso: a pesar de ser punteros igual se deben pasar usando '@'.


  30-ago-2001 leandro   Cambios en los nombres de las clases que implementan las listas ...

    se cambi:
          TList         por TSilList,
          TStringList   por TSilStringList,
