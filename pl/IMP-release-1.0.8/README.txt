For all of you that always wanted to know whether they should use monads
for evaluating the semantics of imperative languages within OCaml...

Directory "monad" contains a monadic style implementation of the
semantics of the (very simple) language IMP, "plain" the implementation
with explicit passing of state.

The semantics of the IMP-language is presented in the book:
  
  "The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages" by Glynn Winskel
  (1993, The MIT Press).

For more details on monads, see Philip Wadler's page on:

Enjoy!
