"IBM" is International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries.

"License Information" ("LI") is a document that provides information specific to a Program. The Program's LI is available at http://www.ibm.com/software/sla/ . The LI may also be found in a file in the Program's directory, by the use of a system command, or as a booklet which accompanies the Program.

"Program" is the following, including the original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), 4) related licensed materials, and 5) license use documents or keys, and documentation.

A "Proof of Entitlement" ("PoE") is evidence of Your authorization to use a Program at a specified level. That level may be measured, for example, by the number of processors or users. The PoE is also evidence of Your eligibility for  future upgrade prices, if any, and potential special or promotional opportunities. If IBM does not provide You with a PoE, then IBM may accept the original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom You acquired the Program, provided that it specifies the name of the Program and the usage level acquired. 

"You" and "Your" refer either to an individual person or to a single legal entity.
